## Background

This repository reproduces the results from the 2D Convolutional Neural Networks C1 and C2 denoted from "Morphological classification of galaxies with deep learning: comparing 3-way and 4-way CNNs" by Mitchell K. Cavanagh, Kenji Bekki and Brent A. Groves (https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/506/1/659/6291200), as well as further exploring their application through the use of the Galaxy10 SDSS dataset.

The results of Cavanagh et al. are replicated in this repository for the new "C2" network introduced in the paper, and their old "C1" network they used previously, using both PyTorch and Keras for each. Cavanagh et al. had originally used Keras to run their neural networks. This repository runs both neural networks using PyTorch and Keras, in order to compare the models further.

The main work completed did for this project is located in the notebooks folder. Its contents contain the code and structure used to train and test the models. In order to minimize their completion time the code is set up to be initially run using Google Collab, which utilises their computing resources. However, the files containing the Pytorch code can all be run locally, as the code has been adapted to run in python files provided in this repository.
