### Webb Galaxy Counter: A Simple Notebook for JWST Data Analysis and Visualization 
* Team lead for a group of 4 who tackled the moonwalker (advanced) Canadian Space Agency (CSA) challenge called “Exploring the distant universe with the James Webb Space Telescope”.
* Over one weekend, with help from Space Apps mentors and existing JWST resources developed by the Space Telescope Science Institute, we created a Python notebook for JWST data analysis and visualization as well as a children’s story book using generative AI.
* Our team won 1st place at the Hamilton event and the overall CSA advanced challenge division.
