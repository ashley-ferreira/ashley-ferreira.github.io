## Background

The Astromatic summer program, run by the Ciela Institute at Université de Montréal and I participated in its innaugural year in 2022. This program selected 15 outstanding undergraduate students from 8 different countries converged in Montréal for three days of expert lectures on foundational topics and research, programming workshops and career activities. The week culminated in an astro-ML hackathon, where I worked as part of a team of 3 to train a ResNet deep learning model to estimate parameters of strong gravitational lensing from simulated images.
