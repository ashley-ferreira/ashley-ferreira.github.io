Including: 

### Reproducing Results of Galaxy Morphology Classification Paper
* Worked as a team of 5 to successfully reproduce results from Cavanagh et al. “Morphological Classification of Galaxies with Deep Learning: Comparing 3-way and 4-way CNNs” with PyTorch.
* Improved accuracy of the models by training on a new dataset with a more balanced number of classes using Keras.
* Received a grade of 100% for my work on this Final Project for PHYS 449: Machine Learning in Physics and every assignment in the course.

### Webb Galaxy Counter: A Simple Notebook for JWST Data Analysis and Visualization 
* Team lead for a group of 4 who tackled the moonwalker (advanced) Canadian Space Agency (CSA) challenge called “Exploring the distant universe with the James Webb Space Telescope”.
* Over one weekend, with help from Space Apps mentors and existing JWST resources developed by the Space Telescope Science Institute, we created a Python notebook for JWST data analysis and visualization as well as a children’s story book using generative AI.
* Our team won 1st place at the Hamilton event and the overall CSA advanced challenge division.

### Strong-Smiling: Analysis of Strong Gravitational Lenses 
* Astromatic is a fully-funded week-long program hosted by the Ciela Institute at Université de Montréal to bring together a group of 15 outstanding undergraduate students interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and astrophysics from around the world.
* Worked as a team of 3 to train a ResNet deep learning model using PyTorch to estimate parameters of strong gravitational lensing from simulated images.
