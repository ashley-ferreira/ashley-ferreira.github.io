A PointNet-based method to better reconstruct antimatter annihilations in hopes of more accurate gravity measurements. You can view an earlier set of my slides [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1299890/contributions/5536572/).

Thank you CCUWiP and the University of Waterloo for fully-funding this conference trip.

This conference gave out presentation awards for each of the themes and this presentation won the 1st place prize for best oral presentation high energy/particle/nuclear/plasma/fluid physics and seismology.
