I'm just getting started on my personal website so apologies that it is still currently **under construction** but feel free to look around.

I'm a keen young researcher with strong data science skills and an interest in using AI to enable scientific discoveries. So far, my main focus has been scientific discoveries in space and the field of particle physics.

One of my biggest hobbies is sailing and so I've dedicated a whole page to it on this website that you should go check out!
