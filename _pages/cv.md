### Notes

Most of this work experience was gained through the University of Waterloo co-op program, where we would alternate between school and work for our entire degree. This also included a 4-month work experience as a **Robotics & Space Operations Intern @ MDA**. You can learn more about my co-op work experiences through an [article](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/blog/post/co-op-time-try-things) the University of Waterloo co-op prgram wrote about me.
