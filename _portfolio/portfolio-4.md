## Overview 
Created a Python tool using Cohereâ€™s LLMs for RAG to summarize United Nations resolutions.

Each resolution was also given an embedding which was used to create a semantic search capability and perform Principal Component Analysis to investigate trends in the data further.

Hosted results online using Tableau visualization and presented slide deck to judges.
