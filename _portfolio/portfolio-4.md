## TL;DR

We can maybe use Machine Learning (ML) to help pick stars for Point Spread Function (PSF) creation to save time in astronomy data processing pipelines.

## Overview 
Created a Python tool using Cohereâ€™s LLMs for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to summarize United Nations resolutions.

Each resolution was also given an embedding which was used to create a semantic search capability and perform Principal Component Analysis to investigate trends in the data further.

Hosted results online using Tableau visualization and presented slide deck to judges.
