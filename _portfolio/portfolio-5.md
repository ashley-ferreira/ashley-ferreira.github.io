## Background

For a final-year undergraduate physics class, PHYS 449: Machine Learning in Physics, myself and some peers teamed up to work on classifying images of glaxies with ML. This is a well worn path as ML has time and time again showed to be an exellent tool at classifyig galaxies based on their morphologies. 

Specifically, part of the project was to sucessfully reproduce the results in a published paper. Our group chose [Morphological classification of galaxies with deep learning: comparing 3-way and 4-way CNNs](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/506/1/659/6291200) by Mitchell K. Cavanagh, Kenji Bekki and Brent A. Groves.

## Results

## Conclusion 
We were able to roughly reproduce the results, and even improve them in some areas, as well as further exploring their application through the use of the Galaxy10 SDSS dataset.


## Code

- Project is publically available on GitHub: [github.com/ashley-ferreira/PHYS449_FinalProject](https://github.com/ashley-ferreira/PHYS449_FinalProject)
- A final presentation is available [here](https://github.com/ashley-ferreira/PHYS449_FinalProject/blob/main/presentations/PHYS%20449%20Final%20Presentation.pdf)


* Worked as a team of 5 to successfully reproduce results from Cavanagh et al. “Morphological Classification of Galaxies with Deep Learning: Comparing 3-way and 4-way CNNs” with PyTorch.
* Improved accuracy of the models by training on a new dataset with a more balanced number of classes using Keras.
* Received a grade of 100% for my work on this Final Project for PHYS 449: Machine Learning in Physics and every assignment in the course.
